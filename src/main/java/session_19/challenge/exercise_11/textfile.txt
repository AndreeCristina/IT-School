Key Characteristics of Java Streams:
Not a data structure: Streams don't store elements; they're a way to process data from a source.
Lazy evaluation: Intermediate operations are not executed until a terminal operation is applied.
Functional style: Encourages declarative programming and immutability.
Pipeline: Data flows through a pipeline of operations.
Immutable: Streams don't modify the underlying data source.
