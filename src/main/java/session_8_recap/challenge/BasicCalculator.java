    Requirements:
    User should be prompted with a message to enter two numbers for the mathematical operation
    User should be prompted with a message to enter the operator that he wants to use( +, -, * or /)
    Consider some validations in case the user doesnâ€™t enter a proper number value
    The number is too large
    The format is not the one we expect
    Any other edge case you can think of
    Instruct the user what he has to do, with a message, if he finds himself on an edge case
    - After the operations is completed, the user should have the option to either enter 2 other numbers for another mathematical operation, or to exit the program */
